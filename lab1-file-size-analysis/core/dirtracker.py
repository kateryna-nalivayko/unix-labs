"""
This module creates a "snapshot" of a directory (its full tree structure).
It detects any file changes since the last check, including:
- files that were added;
- files that were removed;
- files whose contents have changed, even by one byte.

The information about changes is printed to the terminal in the following format:

 - With full absolute paths (if `os.walk()` was run from an absolute path):
[+] New file: /home/user/course/app.py
[-] Removed file: /home/user/Documents/passport.pdf
[~] Changed file: /home/user/Documents/contacts.xlsx

 - Or with relative paths (if `os.walk()` was run from "."):
[+] New file: ./course/app.py
[-] Removed file: ./Documents/passport.pdf
[~] Changed file: ./Documents/contacts.xlsx
